FINE 3300 A - Assignment 1 - Mya Medeiros (219401058)

This is the first Python-based assignment for FINE 3300, which includes two main components: a MortgagePayment class that calculates various mortgage payment schedules (monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, weekly, and accelerated versions) based on user input, and an ExchangeRates class that converts between CAD and USD using Bank of Canada exchange rate data. The program prompts the user for relevant inputs and outputs the results in a clear, formatted manner.
